| Lab | Title                          | Description                                                                 |
|-----|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Linear Regression              | Implemented simple linear regression with gradient descent.                |
| 2   | Softmax Regression (Part 1)    | Built a multiclass logistic regression model using softmax activation. |
| 3   | Softmax Regression (Part 2)    | Improved the softmax regression model performance using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and pixel deskewing on the MNIST dataset. |
| 4   | Neural Network                 | Designed a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify data into multiple classes, and improved performance using dropout regularization. |
